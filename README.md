Homework

Write a program which has two functions, get two numbers from the user in the main like n1 and n2. Then write the first function that accepts two integer values ( n1 and n2 ) as its arguments then swaps the two integers in the function (Call by value). Display the results in the function and display n1 and n2 back in the main function.

The second function is the pass by reference version of the swap. Pass n1 and n2 to this function using reference then display the result in the swap function and display n1 and n2 in the main function.

Add comments and version control.
